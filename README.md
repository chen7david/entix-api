# Express App with TypeScript

This repository serves as a foundational project for building an Express application from scratch using TypeScript. The development process is iterative, focusing on implementing and explaining best practices at each stage, which corresponds to specific tickets in our project management system.

## Project Overview

In this iteration, we have set up the base project structure and defined the necessary packages in the `package.json` file. The following scripts have been created to facilitate development:

- **`dev`**: Runs TypeScript files directly using `ts-node`, leveraging the `tsconfig.dev.json` configuration. This configuration is modular, allowing for different runtime environments such as development, testing, and production.

### Configuration Management

The `tsconfig.dev.json` file is designed to provide a tailored TypeScript configuration for development, ensuring that our code is type-checked and compiled efficiently. We have also structured our TypeScript configurations to support various environments, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

### Purpose of the Repository

This repository aims to serve as a base for collaborating and applying industry best practices within reasonable limits. By following a structured approach, we ensure that our code is clean, maintainable, and scalable, making it easier for developers to contribute and understand the project.

We invite you to explore the code, contribute, and learn about the best practices in TypeScript and Express development.
